# Governance


## Coding Standards

### Metadata Header

— Every source, test, and IAC file in the target project must begin with Metadata Header comment section.
- exclude pom.xml
- Placement: Top of file, above any import or code statements.
- Version: Increment only when the file contents change.
- Date: UTC timestamp of the most recent change.


#### Metadata Header Template
    ```markdown
      /**
      * App: {{Application Name}}
      * Package: {{package}}
      * File: {{file name}}
      * Version: semantic versioning starting at 0.1.0
      * Turns: append {{turn number}} list when created or updated.
      * Author: {{author}}
      * Date: {{YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ}}
      * Exports: {{ exported functions, types, and variables.}}
      * Description: documentate the function of the class or function. Document each
      *              method or function in the file.
      */
    ````

#### Source Versioning Rules

      * Use **semantic versioning** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
      * Start at **0.1.0**; update only when code or configuration changes.
      * Update the version in the source file if it is updated during a turn.

## Logging

### Change Log

- Track changes each “AI turn” in: project_root/ai/agentic-pipeline/turns/current turn directory/changelog.md

- record the list of tasks and tools executed.

#### Change Log Entry Template

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

#### Purpose

The adr.md` folder captures **concise, high-signal Architecture Decision Records** whenever the
AI coding agent (or a human) makes a non-obvious technical or architectural choice.
Storing ADRs keeps the project’s architectural rationale transparent and allows reviewers to
understand **why** a particular path was taken without trawling through commit history or code
comments.

#### Location

    project_root/ai/agentic-pipeline/turns/current turn directory/adr.md


#### When the Agent Must Create an ADR
