# Context

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

A PRD defines outcomes and scope ("what/why) for a product.

It defines the 
- problem
- target users
- measurable outcomes a software product must deliver
- enumerates testable functional requirement
- enumerate non-functional requirements
- constraints
- success metrics
- serves as the "what and why" input to planning, design, and implementation in a spec driven workflow
- a PRD specifies outcomes and not implementation
